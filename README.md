# Library for discrete structures

This library contains models and utilities for common mathematical discrete structures such as relations, mappings, orderings and graphs.

**Please note the program is currently still under construction.**

### Naming convention

Model classes are given names in singular, for example `Mapping`, `Relation` and so on. Utility classes with static methods are named in plural, for example `Mappings`, `Relations` and `Sets`. All words are spelt with British spelling, hence `neighbours` instead of `neighbors` for instance.
